                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Iâ€™m a web developer who is interested in creating innovative software, business and technology solutions.
                        I have worked for large corporations and small businesses in a variety of fields and have transitioned into web development
                        full time.
                        <br />
                        I am a firm believer that through collaboration and communication anything is possible and that understanding the customers
                        needs is a large part of providing excellent customer service.
                        <br />
                        Personally I am huge science fiction / fantasy nerd and recently became a dad. I love traveling the world with my wife and daughter
                        and have the best dog-son a man could ask for.
                        <br />
                        Also, I am a veteran, having served in the US Marine Corps from 2002 to 2006.
